# 📈 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL 2023

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech)**.  
Here, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a sample IPL 2023 dataset to identify winning trends, player performance, and toss decisions using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- File: `IPL_2023_Matches.csv`
- Type: Match-level structured CSV
- Contains: Match ID, Team1, Team2, Toss details, Winner, Player of the Match, etc.
- Source: Custom-created dataset based on IPL 2023 patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

✅ Top winning teams  
✅ Toss decision patterns  
✅ Most frequent “Player of the Match” winners  
✅ Basic cleaning, null check, structure overview

# 📊 Task 3: Data Visualization – Zomato Dataset

This task is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at CodeAlpha**, where I performed data visualization on a restaurant dataset to uncover trends in cuisines, ratings, and customer preferences.

## 📁 Dataset Details
- **`zomato.csv`** – Restaurant listings with details like cost, votes, and cuisines.
- **`Country-Code.xlsx`** – Mapping of country codes to country names.

Merged both datasets using `Country Code` to enrich our data with country names 🌍

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 🧠

---

## 🧼 Preprocessing Steps
- Removed missing values in `Cuisines`, `Aggregate rating`, and `Votes`.
- Converted columns to appropriate numeric types.
- Grouped and aggregated data for storytelling.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Created

1. **Top 10 Cuisines** – Most popular cuisines across all listed restaurants.
2. **Average Rating by Country** – Ranking countries based on average restaurant ratings.
3. **Cost for Two vs Rating** – Scatterplot to check if cost impacts ratings.
4. **Votes Distribution** – Histogram showing user engagement.
5. **Top 10 Cities** – Cities with the most restaurant listings.

All plots are saved in the `plots/` folder for easy viewing.
