# 📈 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis on IPL 2023

This project is part of my **Data Analytics Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech)**.  
Here, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a sample IPL 2023 dataset to identify winning trends, player performance, and toss decisions using Python libraries like **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
